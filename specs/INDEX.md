# Specs Index

This repository is **spec-driven**: specs are the shared source of truth between humans and AI, and are authoritative over conversations.

## Folders
- `specs/framework/`: Nucleus framework runtime specifications (contracts, safety, deterministic execution).
- `specs/plugins/`: Processing-unit (App/Plugin) specifications (domain semantics, heuristics, expected plans).

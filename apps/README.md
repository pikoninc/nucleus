# `apps/`

This directory is reserved for **Apps** (application-level processing units).

## Notes
- Apps and Plugins share the same structural model; the difference is responsibility and composition.
- The Nucleus framework kernel is implemented under `nucleus/`.
- Domain-focused reusable processing units live under `plugins/`.

This repo may start with only `plugins/` and add `apps/` as application integrations are introduced.
